<h2>Introduction of the word <strong>Lemon</strong></h2>
<p calss = "intro2">The word <em>Lemonade</em> came from the word Lemon which first appeared around 1350AD-1400AD, from the middle English word&nbsp;<!--nobreakingspace-->limon.
limon is an old French word, indicating that the Lemon entered via France. The origin of word may be Middle-Eastern as 
it draws from the old French Limon, then Italian Limone, from the Arabic laymūn or līmūn, and from the Persian līmūn, 
a generic term for citrus fruit, which is a cognate of Sanskrit (nimbū, ' lime ').

<p>Lemons are yellow citrus fruits. They are related to oranges1. The fruit has a thick yellow skin that gives off a special aroma
 once cut or peeled. The pulp is pale, yellow-colored, juicy, and acidic, with a distinctive sour taste. Lemon juice is about 5% citric acid,
 and has a pH of 2 to 314. Lemon plants vary in size yet stay generally small, with the tallest height they can get being about 6 meters tall
